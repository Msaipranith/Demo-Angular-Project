In Angular, **data binding** is a way to connect the data in a component with the data displayed in the view (HTML template). Angular supports four main types of data binding, each serving a specific purpose. 

### Types of Data Binding in Angular

1. **Interpolation**: 
   - **Usage**: To display data from the component in the view.
   - **Syntax**: `{{ expression }}`
   - **Example**: `<p>{{ title }}</p>`
   - **How it works**: It binds data from the component to the template, displaying the value in curly braces. Interpolation is one-way, so changes in the component reflect in the view but not vice versa.

2. **Property Binding**:
   - **Usage**: To set properties of HTML elements or Angular directives dynamically.
   - **Syntax**: `[property]="expression"`
   - **Example**: `<img [src]="imageUrl">`
   - **How it works**: This binds data from the component to the DOM properties of HTML elements. Like interpolation, it's also one-way, allowing only data flow from the component to the view.

3. **Event Binding**:
   - **Usage**: To respond to user actions such as clicks, key presses, etc.
   - **Syntax**: `(event)="expression"`
   - **Example**: `<button (click)="onClick()">Click Me</button>`
   - **How it works**: This binds DOM events (like click, keyup) to a method in the component, allowing the component to react to user actions.

4. **Two-Way Binding**:
   - **Usage**: To keep the component and the view in sync, especially useful in form fields.
   - **Syntax**: `[(ngModel)]="property"`
   - **Example**: `<input [(ngModel)]="name">`
   - **How it works**: This combines property binding and event binding. Changes in the component data update the view, and user input in the view updates the component data. For this, you must import `FormsModule` in your app module.

### Differences Between Types of Data Binding

| Type             | Syntax                 | Direction of Data Flow    | Use Case                                     |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Interpolation    | `{{ expression }}`     | Component → View          | Displaying text and simple values in HTML    |
| Property Binding | `[property]="expression"` | Component → View      | Setting properties like `src`, `href`, `disabled` |
| Event Binding    | `(event)="expression"` | View → Component          | Handling user interactions like clicks       |
| Two-Way Binding  | `[(ngModel)]="property"` | Component ↔ View       | Forms and fields where the data flows both ways |

### Summary

- **One-Way Binding** (Interpolation, Property Binding): Data flows from the component to the view.
- **Event Binding**: Data flows from the view to the component.
- **Two-Way Binding**: Data flows in both directions, keeping the component and view in sync automatically.

These data binding types give you flexibility to manage data flow effectively between your component logic and user interface in Angular applications.
